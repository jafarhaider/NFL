# NFL
Python code for capturing, converting, and displaying NFL data

This is a collection of my code (and soon my results) regarding my project concerning NFL statistics.

Sports statistics are season-specific. Rule changes, schedule, injuries, and other factors all play a part in the variation from season to season. From an owner, front office, coaching, player, or fan perspective, consistent success is an obvious goal. For this reason, I posit that the best way to compare statistics over time is not to look at means or absolutes, but to look at the z-score. Simply, to make it to the playoffs, you only need to beat the other teams in a specific year. A z-score of 1.5 when the mean for yards passing is 3200 vs 3700 is very different.

So, I took the passing statistics and took a z-score for each team by season. And then I made line graphs. Some of the figures are very self-evident. Others seem more illuminating and, at the very least, interesting. Here's a preview: playoff teams tend to have a passing efficiency of at least 1 standard deviation above the mean.

My to do list includes: make my figures and results easily accessible, writing more about my findings, and adding in rushing offense, passing defense, and rushing defense.
