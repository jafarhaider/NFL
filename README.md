# NFL
Python code for capturing, converting, and displaying NFL data

This is a collection of my code (and soon my results) regarding my project concerning NFL statistics.

Do teams understand what it takes to win? How can the front office create a team that will win consistently? From my research, teams don't understand this, so I decided to take a closer look. The first question that needs to be answered: what are the factors of consistently successful teams?

Sports statistics are season-specific. Rule changes, schedule, injuries, and other factors all play a part in the variation from season to season. I posit that the best way to compare statistics over time is not to look at means or absolutes, but to look at the z-score. Simply, to make it to the playoffs, you only need to beat the other teams in a specific year. A z-score of 1.5 is very different when the average yards passing is 3,200 vs 3,700.

I took the passing statistics and took a z-score for each team by season. And then I made line graphs. Some of the figures are very self-evident. Others seem more illuminating and, at the very least, interesting. Here's a preview: playoff teams tend to have a passing efficiency of at least 1 standard deviation above the mean.

Can you figure out when Aaron Rodgers replaced Brett Favre as Green Bay's starting QB?

TO DO: 
1. Refactor code
2. Adding in rushing offense, passing defense, and rushing defense.
2. Make my figures and results easily accessible.
3. Write conclusions.
