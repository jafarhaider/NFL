# NFL
Python code for capturing, converting, and displaying NFL data

This is a collection of my code (and soon my results) regarding my project concerning NFL statistics.

Sports statistics are season-specific. Rule changes, schedule, injuries, and other factors all play a part in the variation from season to season. From an owner, front office, coaching, player, or fan perspective, consistent success is an obvious goal. For this reason, I posit that the best way to compare statistics over time is not to look at means or absolutes, but to look at the z-score. Simply, to make it to the playoffs, you only need to beat the other teams in a specific year. A z-score of 1.5 when the mean for yards passing is 3200 vs 3700 is very different.

So, I took the passing statistics and took a z-score for each team by season. And then I made line graphs. Some of the figures are very self-evident. Others seem more illuminating and, at the very least, interesting. Here's a preview: playoff teams tend to have a passing efficiency of at least 1 standard deviation above the mean.

My to do list includes: make my figures and results easily accessible, writing more about my findings, and adding in rushing offense, passing defense, and rushing defense.


Can you figure out when Aaron Rodgers replaced Brett Favre as Green Bay's starting QB?
